# Simple-framwork-of-EDSR
Learning from the open source of EDSR, I build a simpler framework to achieve EDSR. This code is based on Pytorch environment.

Here lacks the dataset DIV2K, you can download the DIV2K from the webite https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/DIV2K.tar.Then, add the unzipped DIV2K folder to the current directory.
